|  STRENGTHS \
-Tailored experience / experience that feels personal \
-Taking 1 – 2 clients at one time = better quality \
|  WEAKNESSES\
-Less staff = more stress\
-Can only take a few customers at a time \
|  OPPORTUNITIES \
-If the business provide great quality & customer service then the business could be spread by word of mouth / more people would suggest other our business \
-If we don’t expand we could be the best in the area if we really tried to\
|  THREATS      \
-People could just use easy websites like SquareSpace \
-People wouldn’t be willing to pay if they think they can do it themselves\
-Bigger companies can shadow over ours since it’s a smaller business

4. We are going to make a website that can store log on data for clients and store information co-insiding with their location ie address and what they are requesting for their website design, ie a list of features and requirements.
